## Website creation
The website could be structured with three different parts in the vertical layout. The first part could be just like some short copy aka marketing with a picture of the book and the title and also a buy now button. Then the next one could be a bit more in depth with the summary of the book and or some more marketing stuff. Maybe also with a generated image or something. Then the last page just like a new link to buy now with some other stuff. We could potentially also add some fake user reviews.
