# Creating Classes

In Python, classes can be created using the "class" keyword, followed by the name of the class. Class names in python should always start with an uppercase letter. A class can have any number of attributes (also known as variables) and methods (functions defined in a class). Every method in a class should take at least one parameter, which is often called "self" by convention.

Here's a simple example of a class in Python:

```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, make, model, year):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.year = year

    def get_make(self):
        return self.make

    def get_model(self):
        return self.model

    def get_year(self):
        return self.year
```

In this example, we created a class called "Car". It has three attributes - "make", "model", and "year" - which are initialized using a constructor (the `__init__` method). The constructor takes three parameters ("make", "model", and "year") and assigns them to the corresponding attributes.

The class also has three methods - "get_make", "get_model", and "get_year" - which return the values of the "make", "model", and "year" attributes, respectively.

Note that every method in a class takes "self" as its first parameter. This is a reference to the instance of the class that the method is being called on. It allows methods to access the attributes of an instance and perform operations on those attributes.

To create an instance of a class, we use the class name followed by parentheses:

```python
my_car = Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 2021)
```

In this example, we created an instance of the "Car" class called "my_car". We passed three arguments to the constructor to initialize the "make", "model", and "year" attributes of the instance.

We can access the attributes of the instance using the dot notation:

```python
print(my_car.make)    # "Toyota"
print(my_car.model)   # "Corolla"
print(my_car.year)    # 2021
```

We can also call the methods of the instance using the same dot notation:

```python
print(my_car.get_make())     # "Toyota"
print(my_car.get_model())    # "Corolla"
print(my_car.get_year())     # 2021
```

And that's it! We have created a class with attributes and methods, and created an instance of the class to access those attributes and methods. In the next sub-chapter, we will delve into methods in more detail.
