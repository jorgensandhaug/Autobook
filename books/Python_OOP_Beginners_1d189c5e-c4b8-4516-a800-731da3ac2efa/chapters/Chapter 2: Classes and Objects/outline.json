      "instructions": "This sub-chapter should briefly and clearly define what classes and objects are and how they relate to each other in Python. The focus should be on providing a basic understanding of classes and objects to the reader. This sub-chapter should not go into great detail about how classes can be created, as that will be covered in later sub-chapters. The length of this sub-chapter should be around 3 pages.",

      "instructions": "This sub-chapter should provide clear, step-by-step instructions on how to create classes in Python. All the concepts presented should be illustrated with code examples that are easy to follow and well-commented. However, as this sub-chapter focuses on creating classes, we should not go into detail about how to use constructors to initialize objects or how different types of variables work. It should be around 5 pages long.",

It will explain the difference between constructors and methods and how constructors are used in Python to initialize objects. This sub-chapter will also cover some best practices when initializing objects.",

It should clearly define what constructors are and how they differ from methods. This sub-chapter should be well-commented with code examples that are easy to follow. This sub-chapter should not go into detail about how to create classes, as that was covered in the previous sub-chapter. The length of this sub-chapter should be around 5 pages.",

This sub-chapter will also provide some best practices when using different types of variables in classes.",

All the concepts presented should be illustrated with code examples that are easy to follow and well-commented. This sub-chapter should not go into detail about how to create classes but should refer back to the previous sub-chapter. The length of this sub-chapter should be around 5 pages.",
