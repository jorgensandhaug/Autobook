This book serves as an introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using Python, aimed at beginners with no prior experience in OOP. The book starts by explaining the concept of OOP using simple language and plenty of code examples. It gradually moves into more advanced topics such as classes, objects, inheritance and polymorphism. Each chapter includes exercises to test the reader's understanding of the material. The writing style is clear and concise, with a friendly and approachable tone. The book does not mention the author's personal experience in the subject. All code examples are easy to follow and well-commented. 

Chapter 1 serves as an introduction to OOP and its importance, explaining the basic concepts such as classes, objects, and methods. Chapter 2 delves into the basics of classes and objects in Python, defining what classes are and how objects are created from classes. Chapter 3 explains what methods are in Python classes, how they are created and used, and how they differ from regular functions. Chapter 4 focuses on the concept of inheritance in OOP, explaining what inheritance is and how it can be used to create new classes from existing ones. Chapter 5 provides an in-depth explanation of polymorphism in Python, covering what polymorphism is and how it works, and how to implement it using methods, classes, and objects. 

Chapter 6, the final chapter, delves into more advanced topics such as composition, aggregation, and encapsulation. It explains each concept in detail and provides examples of how each can be used in Python. This chapter is intended to provide a deeper understanding of OOP for those who have mastered the basics. It also provides tips on how to design effective class hierarchies and when to use each of these concepts. Finally, the chapter ends with a review of OOP in Python and a discussion on how to continue learning OOP beyond the book.
