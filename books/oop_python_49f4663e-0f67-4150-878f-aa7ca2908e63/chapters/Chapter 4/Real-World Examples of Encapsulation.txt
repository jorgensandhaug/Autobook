# Real-World Examples of Encapsulation

Now that we understand the concept of encapsulation and how it is implemented in Python using access modifiers, let's take a look at some real-world examples to demonstrate how encapsulation works in practice. 

One example of encapsulation is a bank account class. In this class, the balance variable is private and can only be accessed through methods like deposit and withdrawal. This prevents any unauthorized access to the account balance, ensuring security. For instance, a hacker cannot access the balance of someone's bank account without knowing the authorized access methods.

Another example of encapsulation is a person's class, where the private data can include sensitive information like social security numbers, credit card information, and passwords. In this scenario, these private attributes can only be accessed via authorized methods to prevent unauthorized access and maintain data integrity.

Python's built-in modules and libraries also use encapsulation to ensure data security. For instance, datetime class in the datetime module has a private attribute called _year, which can only be accessed using get and set methods, respectively. This ensures that the year attribute remains within a specific range to maintain data sanity.

Encapsulation improves code quality by decoupling the class from the external world. This means the internal working of a class can be hidden from external forces, with only the relevant data made available through authorized methods. Encapsulation also ensures that data integrity and security are maintained.

## Public, Private and Protected access modifiers

Encapsulation in Python using access modifiers ensures that the internal state of an object can only be changed through well-defined methods. In Python, we have three access modifiers; public, private, and protected.

A public variable can be accessed from anywhere, while private variables can only be accessed within the class they are defined in. Protected variables are accessible from within the same class, and from within derived classes.

To illustrate the above concepts, let's work with an example of a Car class. In this class, we define an engine attribute which is private, a make attribute which is public, and mileage attribute that is protected. 

```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, make, model, mileage, engine):
        self.__engine = engine
        self.make = make
        self._mileage = mileage
        self.model = model

    def get_engine(self):
        return self.__engine

    def set_engine(self, engine):
        self.__engine = engine

    def get_mileage(self):
        return self._mileage

    def set_mileage(self, mileage):
        self._mileage = mileage
```

In the Car class above, we used the double underscore prefix to define a private attribute called __engine. We can only access this attribute using methods such as get_engine and set_engine, which maintain data integrity.

The mileage attribute, which is protected, is defined using a single underscore prefix. It can be accessed from within the Car class and derived classes without exposing it to the outside world.

The make attribute is public and can be accessed from anywhere.

## Conclusion

Encapsulation is a powerful concept in OOP, particularly in Python. It can be used to improve code quality, security, and maintain data integrity. Access modifiers, such as public, private, and protected, ensure that internal class state can only be modified through authorized methods, thus promoting encapsulation. OOP beginners should take the time to understand this concept and practice encapsulation within their projects.
