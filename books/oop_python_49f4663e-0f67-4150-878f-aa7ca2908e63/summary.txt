This book provides an introductory guide to Object Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python for beginners with basic knowledge of Python programming. Readers will learn about the advantages of OOP and the basic concepts of OOP including inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction. The writing style is simple and easy to understand, avoiding technical jargon as much as possible. Real-world examples are used to illustrate the concepts, and exercises are provided at the end of each chapter to reinforce the concepts learned. The book guides the reader with step-by-step instructions and encourages the reader to practice each concept until they have a good grasp on it. 

The first chapter provides an overview of OOP, while the second chapter explains classes and objects in Python. The third chapter covers the concept of inheritance in OOP and different types of inheritance, such as single, multiple and multilevel inheritance. The next chapters explain encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction. These concepts are explained in detail and demonstrated with real-world examples. 

Finally, the book covers advanced topics in OOP, including composition, interfaces, abstract classes, and decorators. The last chapter summarizes the key concepts covered in the book and provides sample coding exercises to reinforce each concept learned. The book is instructed to use clear examples to help illustrate the concepts and to include exercises at the end of each chapter to reinforce the concepts learned. The tone should be friendly and encouraging to encourage readers to continue learning.
