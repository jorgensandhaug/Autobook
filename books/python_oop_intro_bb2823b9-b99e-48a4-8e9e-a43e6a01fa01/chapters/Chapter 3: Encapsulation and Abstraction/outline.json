It will explain the use of the underscore (_) symbol to specify protected attributes and methods and the double-underscore (__) symbol to denote private attributes and methods. It will provide examples of how these can be used in encapsulation.",
      "instructions": "The sub-chapter should be well-articulated and detailed, explaining thoroughly the concept of private and protected attributes and methods. It should provide appropriate examples of how these can be used to enforce encapsulation in Python. There should be no redundancy with details or concepts covered in the previous sub-chapters or chapters.",
