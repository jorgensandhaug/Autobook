      "title": "GUI Programming with OOP",
      "outline": "This sub-chapter will cover how to use OOP to create graphical user interfaces. It will start with the basics of creating a simple GUI using Python's built-in tkinter module, and then demonstrate how OOP can be used to create more complex GUIs. Topics such as creating custom widgets, using layouts, and handling events will be covered. Examples and exercises will be provided throughout the sub-chapter to solidify the reader's understanding of GUI programming with OOP.",
      "instructions": "Explain how to use OOP to create graphical user interfaces with Python's tkinter module. Start with the basics of creating a simple GUI, and then show how to use OOP to create more complex GUIs. Provide examples and exercises that help the reader better understand GUI programming with OOP. Identify potential pitfalls to avoid when creating GUIs with OOP. Do not include basics of OOP like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism in this sub-chapter.",

It will begin by outlining best practices for writing code that is clean, modular, and reusable. It will then explore common pitfalls that programmers should avoid, such as overcomplicating code, using inheritance excessively, and creating overly complex class hierarchies. Examples of good and bad code will be shown throughout the sub-chapter to better illustrate the concepts presented.",
